# CapstoneTwo
This project seeks to estimate housing cost changes pre and post pandemic and attempt to coorelate this with recession and depression housing changes.

Population data, Neighborhood price history are different variables I'd like to calculate to make this work.  The population data may be out of scope, but # of houses sold in the area may be an interesting statistic.

Methods I'm planning on using are Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and ADA Boosting.
